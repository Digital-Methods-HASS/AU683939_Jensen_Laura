```

## Taks 1

First i make sure that the package tidyverse is activated
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
Then i'll load my dataset, which I have moved to my files
```{r}
regents <- read_csv2("data/kongerÃ¦kken.csv")
```
Then i have to create a vizualization in ggplot

```{r}
regents %>%
  mutate(Regents_Name = reorder(Regents_Name, Length_of_reign)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Length_of_reign, y = Regents_Name)) +
  geom_col()
```

I first use mutate() to sort the regents by the duration of their reign, then i use ggplot() to tell which coloumns from my data fram I want on which axis, and then I use geom_com() to make sure that i get the visualization og the length of reign in columns.
